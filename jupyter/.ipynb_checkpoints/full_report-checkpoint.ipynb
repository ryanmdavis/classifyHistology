    "# Introduction\n",
    "Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has the highest recurrence rate of all cancers and there is a pressing unmet need for technologies that can prevent or prolong time to recurrence. NMIBC is commonly treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), a procedure where a urologist uses a cystoscope to guide resection of the tumor with forceps (Figure 1). A major limitation of the TURBT procedure is that some regions of cancer tissue are invisible to the physician on the cystoscope, and those regions are not resected and are left behind after surgery. These residual cancer cells will then continue to proliferate, leading to recurrence. Strikingly, the median recurrence time for NMIBC treated with TURBT is only 1-2 years, which results in multiple TURBT procedures per patient throughout the course of the patient's disease. Patients can undergo six or more TURBT procedures during their lifetime, which is not only stressful and unpleasant to the patient, but is also expensive to the healthcare system as a whole. There is therefore an critical need for technologies that detect residual cancer cells during or after TURBT procedures, so that urologists adequately treat the disease with additional TURBT or intravesical therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been considerable progress in developing advanced cystoscopy technologies that allow more accurate localization of tumors and more complete resection of tumors during TURBT. Advances include anti-CD47-conjugated quantum dots which bind specifically to lumenal tumor CD47 (Pan Y, et. al. Sci Trans Med. 2014, 6, 260ra148), photodynamic diagnosis based on imaging of intravesical hexaminolevulinate, confocal endomicroscopy for point evaluation of tissue tumor status (Liu JJ, J Urol. 2012 Aug;188(2):361-8; Chang TC Bladder Cancer 2017, 3, 149â€“159), and multiplexed molecular imaging of CD47, CA9, and urothelial permeability with surface-enhanced Raman scattering nanoparticles\n",
    "[Davis RM, Gambhir SS, et. al., 2018. ACS Nano](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.8b03217). These techniques combined with traditional cystoscopy show promise for providing more accurate localization of bladder tumors during TURBT, which may result in more complete resection and prolonged time to recurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although advanced imaging technologies hold great promise in revolutionizing the way we treat NMIBC, those techniques are not currently practical for a vast majority of urology practices. An alternative approach would be to automate the current histological and pathological workflow performed on tissue resected during TURBT. Automation would allow physicians to evaluate substantially more tissue sections, thereby increasing the probability that urologists would detect residual cancer in the margins of resected bladder tissue. Because residual bladder cancer can be present as microscopic foci, we hypothesize that evaluation of more tissue sections will decrease the likelihood of missing residual bladder tumor which would otherwise be missed with the standard pathology workflow. Since recurrence risk directly factors into many urologists' approach for managing NMIBC, characterization of recurrence risk using the algorithm developed herein would influence the decision to prescribe additional treatments such as TURBT, intravesical chemotherapy, or BCG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I illustrate a proof-of-concept approach to automate evaluation of H&E-stained images of tissue resected during TURBT procedures with the goal of identifying residual tumor likely to lead to recurrence. This approach uses a combination of automated whole-slide imaging and convolutional neural networks to identify microscopic dysplasia in H&E images of tissue margins resected during TURBT (Figure 1). The algorithm takes as input a series of H&E images obtained from presumably healthy tissue resected from the margin of NMIBC. The algorithm then identifies the lumenal surface of the bladder tissue, which is the potential location of NMIBC, and scans the surface using a convolutional neural network trained to identify suspicious regions of the urothelium. As shown in the Figure 1, the algorithm annotates the surface of the tissue with a line, identifying suspicious regions in red. The suspicious regions can then be evaluated by a pathologist who could determine if residual cancer is present or not. In summary, I envision that this technology could be used by pathologists to identify patients whose bladder tumors are more likely to recur after TURBT, thus providing valuable information needed to guide treatment for NMIBC after a TURBT procedure.\n",

    "Tissue was obtained fresh from TURBT procedures and put on ice within 15 minutes of resection. For this study, a total of 5 normal and 5 tumor samples were obtained from 4 different patients. Tissue samples were frozen in OCT, sectioned at 5 um, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and imaged with a Hatamatsu Nanozoomer whole-slide imaging system at 40x. Tissue samples were classified as normal or tumor based on the urologist's assessment of the tissue at the time of resection, and this classification was used as the actual tissue class for neural network training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Hatamatsu Image Viewer software, images were exported at 20x magnification as portable network graphics (PNG) files. The resulting exported images were fed into the surface delineation algorithm for extraction of [training and test images](#Representative-Bladder-Tumor-Images).\n",

    "Net1 is shown in Figure 2. Convolutional layers are represented by blue rectangles, and the text therein describes the length, width and depth of the layer in terms of number of neurons. All convolutional layers used a 3-by-3 receptive field, stride of 1 pixel, and zero padding of 1 pixel, resulting in an equal length and width of the convolutional layers and its input tensor. The three convolutional layers were followed by two fully-connected layers, with the final fully connected layer outputting two logits corresponding to the two tissue classes, \"normal\" and \"suspicious\". The activation functions were rectified linear units (ReLU). The objective function was cross-entropy, and logits were normalized with a softmax function. The biases and weights were optimized with the adaptive moments (Adam) optimizer with default values for beta_1, beta_2, and epsilon.\n",

    "The above images outline the operation of the surface delineation algorithm used as part of data augmentation. At a high level, a raw H&E image (Figure 3a) is the algorithm input and the output (Figure f, green line) is a vector of row and column pixels delineating the tissue surface. The tissue surface location generated from this algorithm is then fed into data augmentation algorithm, which extracts rectangular images of [cancer](#Representative-Bladder-Tumor-Images) or [normal](#Representative-Normal-Bladder-Images) tissue oriented normal to the tissue surface. Those extracted images are then used to [train](#Network-Performance-on-Training-and-Test-Datasets) the [neural network](#Neural-Network-Architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Surface Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Tissue surface annotation was achieved in three steps. First, the image to be annotated was fed into the [surface delineation algorithm](#Surface Delineation Algorithm) to generate a stack of validation images corresponding to various points along the tissue surface. The stack of images is similar to the representative [cancer](#Representative-Bladder-Tumor-Images) and [normal](#Representative-Normal-Bladder-Images) images shown above, but ordered along the tissue surface. Second, the stack of validation images were fed into the [trained neural network](#Network-Performance-on-Training-and-Test-Datasets), resulting in a probability that each validation image in the stack is cancer. If the probability of cancer for a given validation image was greater than 0.5, it was classified as cancer. Finally, using the surface location and normal vector direction corresponding to each validation image location, the annotation line was superimposed on the H&E image at a slight offset to the tissue surface.\n",

    "[The network](#Neural-Network-Architecture) was trained with a variable learning rate of 0.001 until iteration 5, 0.0001 until iteration 50, and 0.00005 for subsequent iterations. Dropout regularization was used for all fully connected and convolution layers except for the output fully connected layer. The probability of keeping a neuron was set at 1, 0.6, or 0.4. The resulting training dataset classification accuracy (Figure 6a) and loss (Figure 6b) and test dataset classification accuracy (Figure 6c) and loss (Figure 6d) are shown as a function of training iteration and neuron keep probability, P.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in Figure 6a, a dropout keep probability of 1 or 0.6 resulted in 100% classification accuracy in the training dataset. Similarly, the loss for keep probabilities of 1 or 0.6 resulted in a loss of nearly zero by epoch 120 (Figure 6b). For the test datasets, a dropout keep probability of 0.6 resulted in the best test accuracy (Figure 6c) because the regularization prevented overfitting while still allowing the network to learn cancer and normal tissue features. Figure 6d shows that the test dataset loss for a keep probability of 1 increases starting around epoch 15, clearly signifying overfitting. The loss for keep probability of 0.6 or 0.4 had stabilized by the final iteration, showing that dropout regularization prevented overfitting of the data. The network regularized by a dropout keep probability of 0.6 was used in further analysis to annotate images.\n",

    "\n",
    "This proof-of-concept study describes the implementation of an algorithm that combines surface delineation and a convolutional neural network to identify suspicious regions of dysplasia in H&E images of bladder tissue. The algorithm can quickly evaluate a vast number of images and prioritize a few suspicious regions for review by a human, thus enabling pathologists to evaluate more images in less time. This approach can impact clinical practice decisions by giving  urologists useful information about a patient's recurrence risk when deciding between another TURBT procedure, intravesical therapy, or no further treatment."
